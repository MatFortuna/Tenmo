# Tenmo

Tenmo Application: 
 Worked on a team of two developers where we used Java, and SQL to create a program that connects to a database. Users use a client side app to access, 
store and update data on our server side database. For this application we utilized: Java, Spring Boot, PostMan, PostgreSQL, and Git branching and merging.
